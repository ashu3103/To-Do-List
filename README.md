Fork the repo and clone it to your local system, navigate to the root of the project and run:

`$ npm install`

This will install the required packages and initialize the project.

`$ node app.js`

This will run the app at port 3000, visit localhost:3000 to check if it works or not.

Note: Keep the mongod process running, or it will show errors. If you want to add css, then add them in the styles.css file in the public folder. If you want to add more css files, then add them to the public folder and while linking the stylesheet with the page, make sure you keep the href as /{filename}.css, where {filename} is to be replaced with the filename you are using. The same rule goes for js files, if you want to add them.

Bootstrap has already been added, so if you want to use bootstrap classes, then you can directly do so.
